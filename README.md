### About the Event 

In this Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors (MLSA) event, I hosted a watch party for the Student Summit 2023 and guided my attendees through the process of creating a simple machine learning project. Using the Palmer Penguins dataset—an alternative to the IRIS flower dataset—I taught them how to use GitHub Codespaces to set up their development environment and implement a decision tree to classify penguin species. Through this session, attendees learned both how to use Codespaces and how to build the project step by step.
